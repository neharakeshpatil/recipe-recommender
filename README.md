🍴 Recipe Recommendation System is a machine learning and NLP-powered web application built with Streamlit.
It helps users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home, reducing food waste and making cooking easier.

🔹 How it works:

The system uses TF-IDF Vectorization to represent recipe ingredients as feature vectors.

A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model finds the most similar recipes to the user’s entered ingredients.

Recipes are displayed as interactive cards with images, ratings, calories, protein content, and full preparation steps.

🚀 Features

Enter multiple ingredients (comma-separated) to get instant recipe recommendations

View recipes with image, nutrition info, ratings, and procedure

Expandable "View Procedure" for cooking steps

Beautiful card-based UI in Streamlit

Intelligent ingredient matching using TF-IDF + KNN
